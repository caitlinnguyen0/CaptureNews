# CaptureNews

My project aims to answer the question: to what extent is the US online news media employing peace journalism in its coverage of the US-China trade conflict? 

I plan on accessing news articles on the US-China trade conflict through CaptureNews and using sentiment analysis to evaluate its level of peace journalism.
